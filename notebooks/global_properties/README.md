# Description
This part of the repository contains the analysis used to measure 'global' (i.e. in a circular aperture, sometimes with the core excluded) X-ray properties of the LoVoCCS clusters. We also place some constraints on overdensity radii such as $R_{500}$, by iteratively measuring different global X-ray properties.

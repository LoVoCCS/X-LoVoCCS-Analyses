# Description
This part of the repository is concerned with the shape and position of our galaxy clusters. We constrain the morphology of the hot-phase, X-ray emitting, intra-cluster medium for the LoVoCCS sample. We also make comparisons to red-sequence (i.e. the galaxy population) and weak-lensing mass 2D distribution morphologies.

# Notebook summaries

* 'measure_peaks.ipynb' - This notebook is used to measure the X-ray peak coordinate, which acts as an alternative definition of 'central position' (whatever that truly means for a complicated system like a cluster) vs the X-ray centroid.
* 'measure_centroid_posang_conc_censhift.ipynb' - Here we present and explain the analysis used to constrain the X-ray centroid and position angle of the X-ray emission distribution. We also measure the concentration and centroid shift morphological parameters.
* 'mass_xray_cent_comp.ipynb' -

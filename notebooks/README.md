# Description
This section of the repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used for X-ray analysis of LoVoCCS clusters - this analysis is primarily done using the X-ray: Generate and Analyse (XGA) Python module.

# Subsection summaries

* 'global_properties' - This directory is concerned with measuring global X-ray properties for LoVoCCS clusters - i.e. within a circular aperture (sometimes with the core region removed). Properties are measured within fixed radii for all clusters (e.g. 500 or 1000 kpc), or within physically motivated radii (e.g. $R_{500}$ or $R_{2500}$). Conversely, iteratively measuring global properties is also used to constrain overdensity radii (such as $R_{500}$).
